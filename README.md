# FancySearchable

The Booru-on-Rails search parser, extracted to its own gem for use in other projects.

I don't believe in the GPL, this project is just licensed under it because most of the code came from a GPL project.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'fancy_searchable'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install fancy_searchable

## Usage

I dunno, figure it out yourself.
